    <h1>Keychains and Charms: Small Accessories with Big Personality</h1>

    <p>
      Keychains and charms are more than just functional accessories. They add a personal touch to everyday items
      like keys, bags, wallets, and even mobile phones. From minimalist designs to colorful and playful styles,
      these small items help express individuality while keeping essentials organized.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Keychains Are Essential</h2>
    <p>
      Keychains help keep keys secure and easy to locate. Modern keychains come in a wide range of materials,
      including metal, leather, acrylic, and silicone. Many designs also include added functionality such as
      bottle openers, flashlights, or engraved name tags.

    <h2>The Beauty of Charms</h2>

      Charms are decorative accessories designed to enhance the appearance of bags, bracelets, keychains, and
      other personal items. They often feature symbols, letters, or themed designs that reflect personal interests,
      memories, or fashion trends.
